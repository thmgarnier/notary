# Notary
Jupyter Notebook <b>Notary</b> contains three scripts that perform the following operations:

- JPG to PNG with `Pillow`,
- PNG text to TXT with `pytesseract`,
- PDF text to TXT with `pdf2image` and `pytesseract`,
- and a PDF merger with `PyPDF2`.

This tool was initially designed to retrieve valuable information from images, such as screenshots of scanned books.
